    "Last week for HW you built an algorithm that calculated $\\pi$. It did this by determining the area of a circle of unit radius. This week, we'll turn the problem around and use the same technique to calculate the area of an arbitrary shape. We'll some facets of class programming that we've not talked about before - class inheritance (see chapter 9 , the _Inheritance_ section).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is the same as before:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Throw a random number generator to find a point on the plane\n",
    "1. Determine if the point is in or not in the shape\n",
    "1. Keep track of the number in and out\n",
    "1. Calculate the ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need an algorithm to calculate the area given a shape. We'll make the algorithm a _function_ and the shape a _class_. We'll define a short base class that defines how we want the class to work, and then allow inheritance for the definition of any actual shape.\n",
