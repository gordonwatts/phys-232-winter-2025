    "Lets build on the classes objects that we looked at during class. The goal is to write some code that will calculate the missing momenta of a collision. We'll need to build a few new tools in order to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) experiment two protons are collided - both are going the same speed when they hit - so the lab frame is the same as the center of mass frame. Since momentum conservation holds as well in particle physics as it does anywhere else, since the initial momenta is zero the final momenta must also be zero (see note below). As a result, summing the total momenta of all measured particles is a very useful way to see if we've missed anything! This missed thing could be a neutrino (which does not interact with the detector and so carries away some energy), or it could be dark matter! As a result, missing momentum is a very hot topic!\n",
    "\n",
    "_NOTE_: $\\vec{p} = 0$ isn't 100% true for two reasons. The main one is that at the energies that ATLAS runs at the protons aren't what interact - it is the quarks inside the protons. And the quarks are moving relative to the proton's center-of-mass. This is only an issue along the boost direction (beam direction). As a result it is only $p_x$ and $p_y$ that we rely on being zero after the collision! On the other hand, $\\vec{p} = 0$ is true in a lepton collider (like the LEP collider at CERN or AMY in Japan). For this HW, we'll consider all three dimensions."

    "To do this we need to learn about python's random number generator. The ones we use come from the [`random` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html), which is part of a python distribution. If you are doing anything \"big\" you'll use other random number generators, like the ones in the [`numpy` module](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html). There are several things to be aware when using a random number generator:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you are going to do something requiring a large number of random number generators it pays to find a good generator. The quality of the generators is all over the map. Any that have a _pattern_ will mean you will likely explore some parts of your phase space than others - thus leading to a bias in your results.\n",
    "* The second thing is that random number generators are... random. This means if you run your result twice you won't get the same answer. This can be particularly vexing when you are trying to track down a bug. To this end, most scientific codes carefully track the [random number _seed_](https://www.statisticshowto.com/random-seed-definition/#:~:text=A%20random%20seed%20is%20a%20starting%20point%20in,a%20computer%20system%E2%80%99s%20clock%20%28Henkemans%20%26%20Lee%2C%202001%29.).\n",
    "* Even if we all use the same seed, there is no garuntee with most algoritms that we'll get the same sequence on all computers. I chose [42](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/42/) as my seed, and the sequence I get below may be different from what you see. But if you choose the same seed, and run on the same computer, you should always get the same sequence!\n",
