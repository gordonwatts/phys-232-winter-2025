Make a bar graph of these results with a python program using matplotlib. Positive bar graphs should be blue and indicated with a positive(\"+\") percentage above the bar graph, and negative bar graphs should be red and indicated with a negative (\"-\") percentage below the bar graph. For each president, download the thumbnail picture from their Wikipedia page and place the image at the horizontal and vertical center of each bar graph. Do not use the plt.tight_layout() option on matplotlib because it is full of annoying glitches."
